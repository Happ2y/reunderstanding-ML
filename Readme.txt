Machine Learning : 
It's an application of Artifical Intelligence where models are trained using existing datasets to predict in future situations without being explicitly programmed for it.
    - Supervised Learning (classification & regression)
    - Unsupervised Learning (clustering & association)
    - Semi Supervised Learning
    - Reinforcement Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.

Types of machine learning models -
    - Classification : Predicts a discrete class
    - Regression : Predicts a continuous value
    - Clustering : Discovers grouping of data
    - Association : Prediction of next possible behaviour
    - Dimensionality reduction : Reduction in size of data
